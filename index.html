                        <p>Nicholas Michael "Nick" Duley is an 18 year old student who was born in Colchester on the 28th December 2000.</p>
						<p>From the ages of 4 to 11, he went to Heathlands primary school, which is located in West Bergholt. After this, he attended St Benedicts Catholic College in Colchester from the ages of 11 to 16, which was where he took his GCSEs. He achieved excellent GCSE results that were mainly in the grade A to B range. He currently attends Colchester Institute where he's studying a BTEC L3 Extended Diploma in Computing (equivalent to 3 A Levels). The course he's currently studying covers modules ranging from the Principles of Computer Science to Mobile Apps Development and Computer Networking. He's predicted to get a "D*D*D" grade, which is equivalent to an "A*A*A" A Level grade. He plans on taking further A Levels in the future to improve his employability prospects. A career ready course that lasts for two years was also studied. The course gives practice on finding employability, improving one's job prospects and how the interview process works. As of September 2019, he will be studying a degree in Computer Science from Newcastle University, which belongs to the prestigious Russell group.</p>
						<p>
						For Nick's experience in a working environment, he was an administrative assistant intern for a local company in Colchester called VR Bound. This company specialised in reviewing VR headsets and games, whilst preparing for an awards ceremony that celebrates the achievements of the VR and AR industry. During his stay at VR Bound, Nick created numerous programs such as a ticket generator in Python and an Amazon web scraper in PHP. These programs significantly helped the company to carry out numerous tasks more efficiently and quickly. He also did research into the products and companies that'll be included in VR Awards 2018. He was credited for his work during a livestream of the event.
						</p>
						<p>
						Nick has many different interests he participates in regularly. He is very interested in the hardware and software aspects of technology, he's developed numerous scripts in Python and is enthusiastic about PC building. For physical activity, he participates in hiking and cycling. One of his main achievements is climbing up Mt Snowden in Wales. Finally, when looking at extra-curricular activities, he's participated in various certifications from the Cisco Networking Academy. Example certs are the Introduction to Cybersecurity and Introduction to IoT. He's also looked at courses on FutureLearn, ranging from maths to computer science to politics. He also owns a driving license, which he passed first time in August 2018.
						</p>
						<p>
						Nick's ambitions for the future are to finish his computer science degree and then find employment or continue studying for a masters in a subject which will likely be Cyber Security. He hopes to work within the IT sector and has other ambitions, such as becoming billingual with another language.
